# Lucy's Dotfiles (for Ubuntu Linux)

My dotfiles for Ubuntu have just started out.
They are fit for my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon.

## Features
### Bash
### Vim
### Tmux
- My `.tmux.conf` is based on [Florian Crouzat's](http://files.floriancrouzat.net/dotfiles/.tmux.conf), where I've commented out stuff and added pane selection key bindings.
### Git
- [scm_breeze](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze) is a MUST-GET for git!

## License
You're free to use anything I did to this repo, but please respect others' licenses within. I'm always happy for [feedback](mailto:me@lucypark.kr).
