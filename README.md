# Lucy's Dotfiles (for Ubuntu Linux)

My dotfiles for Ubuntu have just started out.
They are fit for my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon.


## Features
### Bash
- [z](https://github.com/rupa/z)

### Vi
The following Vim packages are activated via [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
- [ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)
- [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

### Tmux
- My `.tmux.conf` is based on [Florian Crouzat's](http://files.floriancrouzat.net/dotfiles/.tmux.conf), where I've commented out stuff and added pane selection key bindings.

### Git
- [scm_breeze](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze) is a MUST-GET for git!
